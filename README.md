Hi, I’m Kevin Thomas. I’m interested in getting a job as a Software Engineer.
I’m currently learning Python 3 and Django, starting on the front-end side with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
Stay tune for my web app that I will be launching soon.[KevinThomas2022.pdf](https://github.com/kevothom/kevothom/files/10405518/KevinThomas2022.pdf)
